## Welcome to my Github Profile!

As the title suggest, if you are reading this, you have somehow made your way to my github profile.
Feel free to poke around my repositories, they're mostly made up of projects I am working on for school or personal reasons.
Down below is a little bit of information about myself in case you are interested, cheers!

## Coding and Technologies

Currently, my two strongest languages are java and javascript, though I have also been working with python lately for my undergraduate research.
I've worked with C++ before for coursework but I've never done a project outside of school with C++.
In terms of technologies, in the past I have worked with

- ReactJs
- Firebase Authentication
- Google Cloud
