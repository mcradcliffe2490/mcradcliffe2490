## Welcome to my Github Profile!

As the title suggest, if you are reading this, you have somehow made your way to my github profile.
Feel free to poke around my repositories, they're mostly made up of projects I am working on for school or personal reasons.
Down below is a little bit of information about myself in case you are interested, cheers!

## Background Info

I am currently a junior studying to obtain my BS in Computer Science at North Carolina A&T University.
In terms of hobbies, I enjoy playing video games, PC building, and reading everything from comics to Catch-22.
I am also big into music, my favorites include Chance the Rapper, J Cole, and the Japanese artist Eve.

## Coding and Technologies

Currently, my two strongest languages are Java and C++, though I have been mostly working with C++ lately.
My Python is decent, I have been trying to improve and so I will likely pick up a project or two done in Python.
In terms of technologies, in the past I have worked with

- ReactJs
- Firebase Authentication
- Boq Framework
- Guice
